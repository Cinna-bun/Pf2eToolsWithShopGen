				"This crossbow can deliver alchemically infused bolts. The strange weapon has a metal bracket mounted on the side of the stock near the lath. As an action, you can load a single {@filter lesser alchemical bomb|items||Category=Bomb|Item=Alchemical|Type=Specific Variant|Level=[1;1]} into the bracket; this bomb must be one that deals energy damage (such as an {@item lesser acid flask||acid flask}, {@item lesser alchemist's fire||alchemist's fire}, {@item lesser bottled lightning||bottled lightning}, {@item lesser frost vial||frost vial}, or {@item lesser thunderstone||thunderstone}). The next three attacks made with the crossbow deal {@dice 1d6} damage of the bomb's damage type in addition to the crossbow's normal damage. If the second and third attacks are not all made within 1 minute of the first attack, the bomb's energy is wasted. These attacks never deal splash damage or other special effects of the bomb and are not modified by any abilities that add to or modify a bomb's effect. The addition of the bracket serves to unbalance the weapon, reducing its range to 30 feet.",
