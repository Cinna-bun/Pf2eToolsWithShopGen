Instead, poppets are most common in large cities, surrounded by the bustle of crowds.

Poppets usually have a network of allies to draw upon in their communities; for many poppets, this network includes their creator and their creator's associates, but even poppets who don't know their creator tend to make themselves useful and liked."
